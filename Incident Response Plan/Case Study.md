  ### Scenario:
Shopme, a mid-sized e-commerce company, was targeted by a ransomware attack. An employee unknowingly clicked on a malicious email attachment, which allowed attackers to gain access to the company's network. The ransomware encrypted critical customer data and internal files, rendering them inaccessible. The attackers demanded $500,000 in Bitcoin to restore the data, threatening to release sensitive customer information if the ransom wasn’t paid.

Your task is to define goals, scope, risk assessment and is, making a robust Incident Response Plan for this breach.

### Goal:

- To document and analyze the cybersecurity breach that affected Shopme platform.
- To develop a structured incident response plan to mitigate the attack and prevent future occurrences.
- To outline the steps for recovery and risk mitigation following a ransomware attack.

### **Scope:**

The case study focuses on the following:

- The nature of the ransomware attack and its impact on Shopeme's platform.
- The weaknesses in security infrastructure that allowed the breach.
- A comprehensive incident response plan that includes containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

### Risk Assessment:

**Threats Identified:**
_Phishing Attack:_ Employees clicked on malicious email attachments, granting attackers initial access to the network.
_Ransomware:_ The malware encrypted critical data, causing operational paralysis.
_Data Breach:_ Sensitive customer information was at risk of being exposed to the public or sold on the dark web.
**Vulnerabilities:**
_Lack of Employee Training:_ Employees were not adequately trained in phishing detection and cybersecurity hygiene.
_Insufficient Endpoint Security:_ Lacking advanced threat detection mechanisms allowed the ransomware to spread through the network.
_Weak Backup Strategy:_ There was no robust, recent backup of critical data, extending recovery times and increasing the risk of permanent data loss.
**Business Impact:**
_Downtime:_ Operations were halted for 72 hours, resulting in significant financial losses.
_Data Loss:_ Without backups, there was a risk of losing 6 months’ worth of transactional and customer data.
_Reputation Damage:_ Customer trust was damaged, potentially leading to long-term loss of business.

### Incident Response Plan:

**Preparation:**

- Employee Awareness Program: Conducting regular phishing simulation exercises and cybersecurity training to educate employees on recognizing malicious links and attachments.
- Endpoint Protection: Deploying advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify suspicious activity before ransomware can spread.
- Backup Strategy: Implementing a robust backup solution with automated, frequent backups stored in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., cloud-based with encryption).

**Identification:**

- Incident Detection: Use security monitoring systems to detect the breach. The IT team identified unusual file encryption activity and ransom notes across multiple devices.
- Initial Analysis: IT security professionals confirmed the presence of ransomware through endpoint logs and network traffic analysis, identifying the strain of ransomware and the entry point via a phishing email.

**Containment:**

- Immediate Action: Disconnect all infected systems from the network to prevent the ransomware from spreading further.
- Network Segmentation: Segment network traffic to contain the attack to isolated sections of the environment, limiting access to sensitive data.
- Account Lockdown: Disable compromised accounts and reset passwords for all employees.

**Eradication:**

- Malware Removal: Use anti-malware software to remove the ransomware from infected systems. Clean compromised systems through a system restore and ensure that no traces of the ransomware remain.
- Patch Vulnerabilities: Apply necessary patches and updates to all systems to close the security holes exploited during the attack.

**Recovery:**

- Data Restoration: Restore encrypted data from backups, ensuring data integrity and that no malware remains in the recovered files.
- System Revalidation: Conduct extensive testing to confirm that all systems are malware-free and operational. Gradually bring systems back online, prioritizing critical business services.
- Monitoring: Increase monitoring efforts to detect any signs of residual malicious activity.

**Post-Incident Analysis and Lessons Learned:**

- Root Cause Analysis: Review logs and attack vectors to understand how the phishing email bypassed security measures. Identify whether email security protocols (e.g., spam filters, domain checks) were bypassed.
- Policy Update: Strengthen the company’s email security policies, focusing on stricter filtering, better threat intelligence integration, and user training.
- Penetration Testing: Schedule regular internal and external penetration tests to simulate future attack scenarios and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion(Optional):
The ransomware attack on Shopme exposed critical weaknesses in the company’s cybersecurity defenses, primarily in employee training and data backup strategies. By executing the  incident response plan, the company minimized damage, restored operations, and developed stronger defenses for the future. Through continuous monitoring, improved employee training, and a fortified backup system, Shopme, significantly reduced its risk of future breaches.
