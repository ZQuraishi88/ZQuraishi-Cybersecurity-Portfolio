# Automated Incident Response Toolkit

This Python script automates key tasks in the incident response process, such as extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), parsing logs, and prioritizing security alerts.

## Features
- **IOC Extraction**: Identifies IP addresses and URLs from log data.
- **Log Parsing**: Extracts timestamps and alerts from logs.
- **Alert Prioritization**: Assigns priority levels based on keywords.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using: `python incident_response_toolkit.py`

## Future Enhancements
- Adding support for more complex log parsing.
- Integrating the toolkit with security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
