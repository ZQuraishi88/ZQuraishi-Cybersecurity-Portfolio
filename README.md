### PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY:

Hi, I’m Zainab Quraishi. I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology and social impact, particularly through cybersecurity. As a woman in tech, I love researching cybersecurity breaches and staying ahead of the latest trends.
I’m currently learning advanced concepts in cybersecurity as I prepare for the CISSP exam. I’ve completed NUCAMP's cybersecurity bootcamp and earned certifications in cybersecurity foundation, network defense, and ethical hacking, which are equivalent to CompTIA Security+, GIAC Security Essentials, and CEH. I also recently achieved my CompTIA Security+ certification.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on protecting digital infrastructures and assisting organizations in fortifying their security posture.I’ve built a comprehensive skill set in network defense, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking. Through hands-on labs (TryHackMe), guided by experts, I’ve gained practical experience in managing cyber threats, risk management, and data protection. My training includes using tools like NMAP, Wireshark, Kali Linux, and Metasploit to identify vulnerabilities and build robust defenses. I’ve explored both offensive and defensive security through blue-team/red-team simulations, learning to think like a hacker while protecting digital infrastructures. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a social service professional at heart and love giving back to society, blending my passion for tech with my dedication to making the world a safer place. I’ve recently completed an internship as a cybersecurity analyst, where I honed my skills in real-world scenarios!
